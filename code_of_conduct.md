RailsBridge is an organization dedicated to increasing equality in tech through education and community.

We value the participation of each member of the RailsBridge community and want all attendees to have an enjoyable and fulfilling experience. Accordingly, all attendees are expected to show respect and courtesy to other attendees throughout RailsBridge events, whether officially sponsored by RailsBridge or not.

To make clear what is expected, all attendees, organizers, volunteers, and sponsors at any RailsBridge event are required to conform to the following Code of Conduct. Organizers will enforce this code throughout the event.

The Short Version
-----------------

RailsBridge is dedicated to providing a harassment-free workshop experience for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of workshop participants in any form.

All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any workshop venue, including talks.

Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other attendees. Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate for RailsBridge.

Attendees violating these rules may be asked to leave the workshop at the sole discretion of the workshop organizers.

Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly event for all.

The Longer Version
------------------

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Be careful in the words that you choose. Remember that sexist, racist, and other exclusionary jokes can be offensive to those around you. Excessive swearing and offensive jokes are not appropriate for RailsBridge.

If a participant engages in behavior that violates this code of conduct, the workshop organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the event.

Contact Information
-------------------

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of the organizing team. The organizing team will identify themselves during the opening presentation, and volunteers will generally be identifiable by their nametags (usually with a star).

Because RailsBridge events take place globally and with different organizing teams, the contact information for those teams will vary event to event. If you are not comfortable contacting any members of the organizing teams, please reach out to the RailsBridge meta-organizing team:
